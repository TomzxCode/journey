# Weekend Reflections - 2024-09-22

## Saturday Adventures

Spent the day exploring local hiking trails and working on personal projects. The directory auto-loading feature is working perfectly!

### Technical Notes
- Recursive directory scanning works well
- File type filtering is responsive
- Auto-load toggle provides good user control

### Personal Notes
- Fresh air helps with creative thinking
- Weekend coding sessions are enjoyable
- Good to have a flexible file organization system
